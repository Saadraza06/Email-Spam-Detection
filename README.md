# Email-Spam-Detection
ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection ðŸš«
Overview
A machine learningâ€“powered email spam detection system, developed during my Data Zenix internship, to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Built using Python and popular data science libraries, this project demonstrates end-to-end developmentâ€”from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Language & Libraries

Python â€“ core language

pandas â€“ data handling

NumPy â€“ numerical operations

scikit-learn â€“ machine learning algorithms & evaluation
